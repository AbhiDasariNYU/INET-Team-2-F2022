Serenity Score - Find Peaceful Neighborhoods

Serenity Score is a web application that helps users find peaceful neighborhoods. It uses a unique algorithm to calculate a serenity score for each neighborhood in New York City, based on data from the NYC data website. The serenity score is a measure of how peaceful a neighborhood is, taking into account factors such as crime rate, noise level, and access to green spaces.

The web application is built using the Django web framework, with AWS as the hosting platform. Plotly is used for visualizing data and Bootstrap for the frontend design. The project was developed using an agile methodology, with regular sprints and iterative development.
